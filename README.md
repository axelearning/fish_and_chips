# Fish classifier üê†

Through this project I have created a web application which recognize the fish from Reunion Island's lagoon. The way the application works is simple:

1. The user uploads a photo of a fish
2. This photo is sent to the Deep Learning algorithm which makes a prediction
3. This prediction is returned to the user

Here are the different steps put in place in order to realize this project:

1. Collected the data | [get_the_data.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ybB06Y8hXg-3iuXqVMnTCBRF4LGhDJCQ?usp=sharing)
2. Trained the model | [modeling.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UptvOjCSB7BK8Af8NTRGJJm8UPMfy51U?usp=sharing)
3. Built and deploy a web app with streamlit | [app.py](https://github.com/axelearning/fish_and_chips/blob/master/app.py)

## What did I learn?

- **Create my own dataset** by getting pictures from Bing search API
- **Use state of the art deep learning models** : [Resnet50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_neural_network) and apply **transfer learning** to allow the model to adapt to our problem
- **Understand the errors** and improve its performance
- **Deploy a machine learning application** with Streamlit

## Why this project?

At first to `develop my skills in artificial intelligence` and then to `spend more time with my grandfather`, fan of snorkeling, he spends a lot of time observing the fish. He made me discover his world (üê†) I made him discover mine (ü§ñ)!

After explaining him the project we collected photos in the lagoon together to test the performance of the model in production.
